# Twist Overview

Twist is a name resolution system with flexible naming conventions that use human readable strings to implement tags, and thus names. Additionally, Twist uses references called links that help express intra-object relationships. The goal of Twist is to be able to map names to global object IDs. Features include search queries, semantic relationships through links and tags, versioning, and public/private, namespaces.
